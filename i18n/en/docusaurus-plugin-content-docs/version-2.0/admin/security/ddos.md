# DDoS defense

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is a cyber attack where multiple systems flood a target with traffic, overwhelming it and causing service disruption.  

Three common solutions to prevent DDoS attacks:

- Using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and Load Balancers
- Using DDoS Protection Services such as Cloudflare, Akamai, and AWS Shield
- Deploying Firewalls and Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

In addition to this, do some control at the level of Websoft9 Gateway: [Mitigating DDoS Attacks with NGINX and NGINX Plus](https://www.nginx.com/blog/mitigating-ddos-attacks-with-nginx-and-nginx-plus)
