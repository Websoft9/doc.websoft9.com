# Backup the entire server

Backing up an entire server is usually accomplished with a snapshot backup of the cloud server.  

**Cloud server snapshot backup** is an efficient and quick method of data protection. By capturing the state of the server at a specific point in time, including the operating system, applications, and data, snapshots provide rapid recovery capabilities, especially in cases of data corruption or loss. Snapshots are typically stored in the cloud, making them easily accessible and recoverable at any time.
