# Plan or optimize storage

This chapter shows you how to deploy and manage server's disks and storage for application deployment.  

## Plan disk

Linux use disks to store the operating system, applications, and data. When you create a server, it is important to choose a disk size and configuration appropriate to the expected workload.  

The server has two types of disks that can be used to install Websoft9 or applications:  

- **Operating system disk**: It hosts the server's operating system and is optimized for OS performance. Because of this configuration, the OS disk not suggest be used for applications or data.
- **Data disk**: It is an additional disk that you attach to your server to store application data, databases, or other files. Data disks should be used in any situation where durable and responsive data storage is desired. 

Run command `df -Th` to check your disks information.  

## Plan cloud storage systems{#outer-disk}

Cloud storage systems, such as Amazon S3, are online services that provide scalable and durable storage for data. These systems enable users to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web. 

You can use [Rclone](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) to mount cloud storage system as a file system of Linux.  

## Optimize docker volume{#volume}

[Docker Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. 

Websoft9 use [Named Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) which better than [Bind Mounts](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) for the reason that easier permission management.
