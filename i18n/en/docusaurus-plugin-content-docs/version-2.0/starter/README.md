# Getting Started

## Concepts

You should know some important concepts before deploying application by Websoft9:

- **Websoft9 Console**: The Websoft9 Console is a web interface for easy application deployment and management.

- **Application and container**: "applications" are software or services that run on the Websoft9 platform. Technically, each application consists of one or more containers.

- **Application and server**: Applications are deployed on servers (virtual machines). Docker must be installed on the server to run applications on Websoft9.  

Then, start logging into the Websoft9 Console to deploy your applications.  

## Deploy your application
