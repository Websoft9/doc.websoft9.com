3. The first time Scratch loads, it requires more than 20MB of data. If your network bandwidth is inadequate, the loading process will be extremely slow. Please wait patiently!

## Configuration Options {#configs}

- Multilingual (✅): Switchable
- Backend Login (❌)

## Administration {#administrator}

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

#### Not loading or very slow to access? {#slowy}

The first time Scratch loads, it requires over 20MB of data. For example, if you are using 2Mbps bandwidth, the estimated loading time would be:
20000kB / (128kB/s x 2) ≈ 78 seconds. If the bandwidth is insufficient, it will be very slow.

Additionally, Scratch loads Google Stats resources, which may lead to anomalous or slower access.

#### Background and character icons not loading? {#assets}

Reason: Scratch's pre-made character icons and background images are stored on the official server, and there may be network limitations when retrieving them.

Solution: [Download](https://libs.websoft9.com/apps/scratch/asset.zip) the assets to your local computer and use them by **uploading**.
