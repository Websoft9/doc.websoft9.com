# Service Level Agreement

## Definitions

"We"/"us"/"our"/"Websoft9" means the company registered in US. and/or any of its subsidiaries and/or affiliates involved in the provision of the Services.

"You"/"Your"/"Yourself"/"User"/"Customer" means the user of the Website and/or the customer of the Services.

"Services" means all services provided by Websoft9 on its website or other cloud platforms, including but not limited to cloud application deployment, mirroring, management and infrastructure management, commonly referred to as "Websoft9 Multi-Application Self-Hosted Platform". Websoft9 Multi-Application Hosting Platform".

Websoft9 is committed to providing high quality services backed by comprehensive Service Level Agreements.  

Websoft9 may modify the SLA Agreement from time to time, but Websoft9 will not modify the terms of your SLA in a way that materially reduces the level of service during the term of your subscription; if you renew your subscription to the Services, the version of the SLA Agreement in effect at the time of renewal will apply to the term of your renewal subscription. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of the SLA in effect at that time.

## Service Standards

- Websoft9's goal is to ensure that the services are available to our customers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year (Service Availability).

- Please note that Service Availability refers to the Websoft9 multi-application self-hosted platform and related services, and under no circumstances do we guarantee the Service Availability of our partners [cloud providers](#cloud).

- Websoft9 provides two standard support options:

  - **Real-time communication**: interactive and timely communication tools (**Online message and phone**)
  - **[Ticket System](https://www.websoft9.com/ticket)**: non-real-time interactive form system.

- Real-time communication makes it easier to request and receive basic information and troubleshooting assistance. However, real-time communication is subject to resource constraints that require queuing, and to avoid clogging the real-time system, interactive support sessions are subject to a maximum duration depending on the level of support plan you are on:

  - Standard Support - maximum 20 minutes real-time (weekdays 8:00-18:00)
  - Advanced Support - up to 30 minutes live (weekdays 8:00-18:00)
  - Premium Support - unlimited (Monday-Sunday 8:00-22:00)

- When real-time communication fails to resolve the issue or exceeds the response time window for real-time communication, a [Ticket System](https://www.websoft9.com/ticket) will be created by the user or our Customer Success team containing a record of the real-time communication and will be followed up by one of our Senior Engineers through our Work Order system. The expected response time for a work order is as follows:

  - General Priority Work Order (24x7x365)
    - Standard Support - 12 hours
    - Advanced Support - 6 hours
    - Premium Support - 2 hours

  - High Priority Work Orders (24x7x365)
    - Standard Support - 3 hours
    - Advanced Support - 30'
    - Premium Support - 10'

- Our response time goal is the time it takes to identify and have a "Work Started" status only, not the time it takes to resolve the problem.

- High Priority Work Orders must be associated with an incident that results in the unavailability/inaccessibility of the customer's infrastructure and/or services. Other types of incidents that are rated "High Priority" by the customer that do not fit this description will be downgraded to "Normal Priority" by Websoft9 personnel and handled accordingly.

- Premium Support is available 24 hours a day (24x7x365), Monday through Sunday. Our goal is to respond within 10 minutes.  

- Websoft9 recognizes that our service availability and response time goals may not always be met. Therefore, the following section outlines compensation if we do not meet our service availability or response time goals.

## Compensation for non-compliance

If our service standards are not met, we will compensate the customer, provided that the customer applies through our support portal.

The compensation will be issued in the form of vouchers, and this compensation is the full and sole remedy provided by Websoft9 for failure to meet the service availability commitment.

The compensation will be credited to your next billing cycle.

For each service request where we fail to meet the standard level of service, you will receive compensation equal to 5% of the total subscription fee for that month.

The SLA may be accumulated on a monthly basis, with the total compensation not to exceed the total amount you paid us for that month.

## Limitations

The following situations are also not eligible for SLA compensation:

- Failure to meet service standards due to Websoft9's scheduled downtime, emergency maintenance, or force majeure events.

- Failure to meet service standards due to the customer's or their service provider's use of non-standard environments, custom code, or other incorrect configurations of the platform.

- Failure to meet service standards due to cloud infrastructure failures.
