# Society Responsibility

Today's enterprises not only represent the interests of customers, employees and shareholders, but also need to undertake greater social responsibilities, integrate with society, politics and economy, in environmental protection, taxation, legal employment, community responsibility, care for vulnerable groups, etc. Invest in all aspects.  

"Simplify open source, benefit the world" is Websoft9's vision and mission. To undertake the company's vision and mission, we have formulated a social strategy:

## All in Open Source

Websoft9 stratgy is all in Open Source, you can get the source of use [Product](https://github.com/websoft9) and [Docs](https://support.websoft9.com/).  

Through a transparent and open business operation process, communication costs are reduced, cooperation efficiency is improved, and security is more reliable.  

## Multiple employment

The employment method in the industrial age has not adapted to the employment characteristics of knowledge-based talents. With the in-depth development of the Internet, remote and global employment has become the future trend.  

From the perspective of sustainable development, Websoft9 has gradually started to diversify its employment. We have widely absorbed key employment groups defined by the state: college graduates, migrant workers, flexible employment personnel, disabled people, zero-employment family members, women, veterans, Older workers, etc.     

## Public Welfare

Information technology has created a digital divide for underdeveloped rural areas. We have established a rural programming education charity campaign, and plan to provide free programming technology education services to 100 rural primary schools within 10 years, cultivate rural children's interest in programming, and help children. We plant the seeds that will open the door to the future and eliminate the inequalities in information technology to the greatest extent possible.  

In order to improve work efficiency, non-profit organizations need to use a lot of software in their work. We can provide free cloud computing and open source software-related technical support for non-profit organizations to help non-profit organizations establish a more efficient technical system and realize business automation

Technology is undoubtedly the driving force behind current social development and economic prosperity. Technology-leading companies can bring huge productivity to customers around the world.  

Technology also changes our human civilization, Websoft9 strives to eliminate the negative impact of technology on human beings.
