# Customized installation

Custom installation often means software installation, configuration, testing, and deployment don't follow a standardized, reproducible process. This can occur in the following special use cases:

- **Special Hardware**: Custom servers, embedded systems, or special hardware.
- **Isolated Network**: Deployment on servers without internet access.
- **Project Delivery**: On-site delivery within a specific timeframe.
- **High Availability**: Requires additional load balancing and high availability measures.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Custom backup and disaster recovery plans for business continuity.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Deployment services based on hybrid cloud architecture.
- **Security Compliance**: Extra compliance and security measures for specific industries.
- **Process Integration**: Integrating deployment into strict DevOps processes.
- **Multi-Tenant Environment**: Deployment for multiple classrooms, like in higher education.
