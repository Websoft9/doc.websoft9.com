# Post-Installation Setup

After installing Websoft9 Console, make sure you can [login to Websoft9 Console](./login-console) first, then start to **Configure Domain**, **Deploying Applications** and **System Management**

## Configure Domain

Early domain configuration ensures accessibility, security, SEO, and professional appearance.

- [Prepare domain](./domain-prepare)
- [Set global domain (Wildcard)](./domain-set#wildcard)

## Deploy application

Refer to tutorials and hands-on activities to deploy applications and master Websoft9.

- [Deploy applications with templates in one-click](./appstore-guide)
- [Deploy applications with Web runtime](./runtime)

## System administration

As a system administrator, you must ensure system uptime by performing these essential tasks.

- [Upgrade](./upgrade): If the installed version isn't the latest, upgrade before use.
- [Backup and restore](./backup): Start setting up backups immediately after installation; it's a good practice.
