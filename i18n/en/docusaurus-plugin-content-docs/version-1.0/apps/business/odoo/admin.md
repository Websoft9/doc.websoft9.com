This reminder is that you are required to set a strong administrator password for the database as soon as possible. If you do not set it, you will face great risks. Once set, this interface will no longer pop up

#### Could not upload file to Odoo program directory problem via SFTP?

Since some Ubuntu systems have created the default user name ubuntu by default, ubuntu does not have the right to operate the source code or directory of the odoo program for ordinary users. you need to execute the command:

```
sudo chmod o+rw  /usr/lib/python2.x/dist-packages/odoo   # odoo10
sudo chmod o+rw  /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/odoo   # odoo11 or 12
```

#### Odoo can't print Chinese content?

When using the Odoo printing function, the downloaded PDF file is only in English and there is no Chinese part, resulting in incomplete printing. The reason is that the required Chinese font is not downloaded in the system environment. Solution: execute the following command to download fonts

~~~
sudo apt-get install ttf-wqy-zenhei
sudo apt-get install ttf-wqy-microhei
~~~
