# Set domain for application

User can set domain for applications at [Websoft9 Gateway](./gateway_learn) or access managment page of **My Apps**, it includes:   

- Configure global domain
- Binding domain for application
- Change domain binding for application
- Delete domain binding

## Prerequisites

- [Prepare domain name](./domain-prepare)
- Enable **80,443** port of Security Group of your server

## Configure global domain{#wildcard}

Websoft9 supports [Wildcard Domain](./domain-prepare#wildcard), automatically generates independent subdomains for each application.  

This method of configuring a domain name is defined as a **global domain name** which only needs to do domain name resolution and binding once, and can be used by all applications, the specific steps:  

1. Add **wildcard domain resolution** at your DNS console, below is sample

   - **Domain Name**: `websoft9.cn`
   - **Record type**: A
   - **Record**: *.inner
   - **Record value**: Internet IP of server

2. When completed the wildcard domain resolution, you can testing subdomains suffixed with `inner.websoft9.com`
   ```
   ping app1.inner.websoft9.com
   ping app2.inner.websoft9.com
   ping app3.inner.websoft9.com
   ```

3. Login to **Websoft9 Console**, click **Settings** on the left memu, add `inner.websoft9.com` to global domain name item.

5. When completed the installation of application, you can access subdomain for this application.  

## Configure single domain{#app-domain}

If not set [global domain](#wildcard), user need to resolve and bind domain for every application, this method of configuring a domain name is defined as a **single domain for application**. 

For configuring a domain name to application, you just need a A record.  

User can configure single domain at one of two points:  

- When installing the application (Recommendation)
- After installing the application: This method is mean replace application URL, sometime need extra configurations
