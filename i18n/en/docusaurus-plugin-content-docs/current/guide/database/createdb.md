Built-in deployment templates include multiple versions of MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQL Server, Elasticsearch, Oracle Database, Neo4j and other databases, allowing users to deploy their own database services with a one-click.    


## Deploy a database

1. Login to Websoft9 Console, list all databases from **App Store** database catalog

2. Select and [Install](./deployment#appstore) one database you want to use

## Configuration options

In the Websoft9 App Store, database services follow default configurations for security and usability.

- **Running Mode**: Databases run in containers, ensuring consistency and portability.
- **Data Persistence**: Named volumes ensure persistent and independent data storage.
- **External Access**: Databases map to host ports; open ports in security groups for external access.
- **Config Management**: Adjust configurations via container environment variables or mounted config files.

For further customization and redeploy, refer to the [Git repository](./plan-git#manage).
