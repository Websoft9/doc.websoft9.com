#### Installing Multiple Instances of Duplicati 

Description: Installing multiple instances of Duplicati
Reason: Duplicati is bound to the host's **Fixed Path** by default. When installing a second instance of Duplicati, it uses the same path, leading to  permissions issues.     
Solution: It is not recommended to install more than one Duplicati.
