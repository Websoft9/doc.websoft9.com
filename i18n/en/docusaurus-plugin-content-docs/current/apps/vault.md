## Getting Started {#guide}

Once you have completed the installation of Vault via the **Websoft9 Console**, retrieve the application's **Overview** and **Access** information from **My Apps**.

### Client Connection

1. Obtain the container name for Vault, assumed as `vault_name`.
2. To start a client connection, run the following command (replace `vault_name` with the actual value):

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm --net=container:vault_name vault-cli
   ```

3. After establishing the connection, you can start managing secrets using Vault's CLI commands.

### Authentication Setup

1. After the client connects, configure authentication tokens or methods such as GitHub, LDAP, or AppRole, depending on your infrastructure.

2. Use the following commands to initialize token-based authentication:
   ```bash
   vault login <token>
   ```

## Configuration Options {#configs}

- **Secret Engines (✅)**: Enable secret engines like Key-Value, AWS, or PKI to manage secrets specific to different services.
- **Authentication Methods (✅)**: Supported authentication methods include Token, GitHub, LDAP, and AppRole.
- **Audit Devices (✅)**: Enable auditing for security monitoring.

## Administration {#administrator}

1. **Backup and Restore**:

   - Schedule regular backups of the Vault data to prevent data loss. Use Websoft9 console to automate this process.
   - Restore data using the Websoft9 interface or by running CLI commands within the Vault container.

2. **User and Role Management**:

   - Manage users and their access through policies in Vault. Define roles and permissions via the CLI or Web UI.
   - Ensure each user or service has only the necessary privileges by regularly reviewing and updating their policies.

3. **Security and Monitoring**:

   - Set up **Audit Logging** in Vault. Enable this feature through the Websoft9 interface to log and monitor access to secrets.
   - Review the logs regularly for abnormal activities, such as unauthorized access attempts.

4. **Token and Secret Rotation**:
   - Regularly rotate tokens and secrets to maintain security, especially for sensitive environments. Use Vault’s built-in token rotation capabilities.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

1. **Connection Issues**:

   - **Symptom**: Vault is unreachable or the connection times out.
   - **Solution**: Check if the Vault container is running using `docker ps` and ensure that the necessary ports are open (default: 8200). Restart the container using the Websoft9 console or `docker restart <vault_name>`.

2. **Authentication Errors**:

   - **Symptom**: Token authentication fails or expires too quickly.
   - **Solution**: Regenerate tokens using the CLI: `vault token create`. Ensure the correct TTL (Time to Live) is set for tokens, and check the Vault’s configuration for token lifetimes.

3. **Permission Denied**:

   - **Symptom**: Users receive "Permission Denied" errors when accessing specific resources.
   - **Solution**: Verify that the ACL policies are correctly set. You can check policies with `vault policy read <policy_name>` and update them if necessary.

4. **Vault Service Fails to Start**:
   - **Symptom**: Vault fails to start or crashes frequently.
   - **Solution**: Review the Vault logs through the Websoft9 console or by running `vault server -config=config.hcl`. Look for any configuration errors or resource issues and resolve them accordingly.
