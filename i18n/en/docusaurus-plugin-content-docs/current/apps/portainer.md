   ![](./assets/portainer-register-websoft9.png)

2. Follow the guide to complete the administrator account setup. After entering the backend, the system prompts you to set up Environments

   - To manage local containers (recommended): Delete the current installation of Portainer and use the Websoft9 console **Containers** management function directly

   - To manage local containers: Modify the Portaier orchestration file, delete the comment on the line `/var/run/docker.sock`, and it will take effect after you rebuild the application

   - To manage non-local containers: follow the Environments instructions to setup the connection method

3. After completing the Environments setup and connection, you can start managing containers

### Running commands in containers {#docker-exec}

Portainer provides the ability to run container commands visually, which equals to **docker exec -it**.

1. In the list of containers, click the **>_** icon under the **Quick actions** section of MySQL in the following image

    - Command: select available commands to execute (choose one of three, there is always one available)
    - user: default root (recommended)

3. Click **Connect**, if connect successfully then run the command

### Install the app in Portainer {#installapp}

If the Websoft9 App Store does not meet the installation requirements, users can install Docker applications in the container management platform in a self-defined way

- Custom installation of Docker-Compose apps: **Container > Stacks > Add Stack**
- Customized installation of Docker containers: **Containers > Containers > Add Container**

## Troubleshooting{#troubleshooting}

#### Portainer cannot enter the initialization page?

Reason : For security reasons, Portainer will lock the initialization page if it is not accessed within a few minutes after installation.

Solution: Restart the Portainer application

#### Can I delete existing Environments?

If you delete the Environments after you have running containers, the containers will be unmanageable

#### Websoft9 Application VS Portarner Stack?

Portainer creates Websoft9 app containers through its Stack API for managemen

However, there is more to Websoft9 applications, that is, they cannot be completely equated
