## Getting started{#guide}

### Connecting to Elasticsearch{#wizard}

After installing Kibana in the Websoft9 console, view the application details through **My Applications** and get the login information from **Access**.  

1. Prepare the Elasticsearch Enrollment Token and account password information in advance. 

2. Log in to Kibana's initialization interface and enter the [Elasticsearch Enrollment Token](./elasticsearch#token) information for verification (required for first-time login) 

3. After authentication, a screen will prompt you for a username and password.
 
4. After verifying the username and password, you will be able to access the visualization console.

## Configuration options{#configs}
