## Getting started{#guide}

### Prepare the database

CloudBeaver is a tool for managing databases. If you don't have a database yet, you can install one through the Websoft9. 

- The Websoft9 provides one-click installation templates for various databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQLServer, and Oracle.
- Databases installed through Websoft9 can be connected to CloudBeaver using the container ID as the Host without the need to open an external network port.

### Verify CloudBeaver Installation

After completing the installation of CloudBeaver in the **Websoft9 Console**, get the applicaiton's **Overview** and **Access** information from the **My Apps** section.  

1. Open your local computer's browser and visit the URL to complete the installation wizard step by step.
