| Laravel, Django                    | Web framework application         |

### How it work?

App the **App Runtime** templates have the same deployment methods that based on GitOps and [IaC](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/iac/):  

- After launching the App Runtime, Websoft9 create three resources for user to deploy source code or binary, includes: 

  - Git repository
  - language container
  - server block of Gateway

- Then user can upload install packages and add deployment scripts to language container by updating App Runtime


### Common parameters

These are the common parameters for deployment by App Runtime:  

- **Orchestration tool**: docker compose
- **Container Port**: 8080
- **Dockerfile build**: Not support now
- **Execute commands at container**: Yes
- **Preconfigured deploy scripts**: Container directory `/usr/local/bin/cmd.sh` that mount to `src/cmd.sh` of repository
- **Character encoding**: UTF-8
- **Multiply version**: Yes
- **Root directory path**: Docker exec to container and command `pwd` to get path, and below for your references

  - PHP: */var/www/html*
  - Jetty: */var/lib/jetty/webapps*
  - Tomee: */usr/local/tomee*
  - Tomee: */usr/local/tomcat*
  - Nginx: */usr/share/nginx/html*
  - Caddy: */srv*
  - Apache HTTP Server: */usr/local/apache2/htdocs*
  - Other Runtime: */usr/src/app*

### Language specific

Language specific configurations you may need to know: root directory, package manager, install extensions, compilation, command line, container operating system, and more.

## Deploy application Guide{#guide}

App Runtime is a special application of Websoft9. You just need a few steps to deploy application by App Runtime  

### Prepration

- [Set global domain for Websoft9](./domain-set#wildcard)
- [Plan your install packages](./plan-package)

### Step1: Prepare install packages

Your installation package must to be downloaded for Websoft9 App Runtime, it is better than FTP/SFTP upload: 

- No files permission issues and more secure
- More suitable for automated deployment

If your installation package not have download URL, you can create download URL by [Upload files to git repository](./plan-git#create).  

### Step2: Launch App Runtime 

1. [Login to Websoft9 Console](./login-console), go to the **APP Runtime** catalog of **App Store**
   ![](./assets/runtime-catalog-websoft9.png)

2. Install one of App Runtime at Websoft9 Console

3. When App Runtime is running, three resources created for user to deploy source code or binary, includes: 

   - One Git repository
   - One language runtime container
   - A Nginx proxy block in Websoft9 Gateway, it proxy to language runtime container's **80** port

### Step3: Customize App Runtime{#dockercompose}

You can update the App Runtime deployment by Git repository when it running, major operations includes: 

   - Modify the image tag in the file `docker-compose.yml` to replace the default started container  
   - Add more services or other elements to `docker-compose.yml` file 
   - Add more environments to `.env` file  
   - Modify **W9_VERSION** at file `.env` or other version item at file `docker-compose.yml` for upgrading containers  

You should redeploy App Runtime after customizing any items, then it will take effect.  

If you want to modify environments starting with **W9_**, you need to familiarize with [Websoft9 templates format](https://github.com/Websoft9/docker-library/blob/main/docs/code_owner.md#environments).

### Step4: Deploy packages to App Runtime

Deploying packages is mainly done below steps by commands in the App Runtime container:  

1. **Upload packages**: Download packages to container and extract to the root directory

2. **Build program (optional)**: Compile and build packages

3. **Launch the program**: Run the program's startup command

   - Make sure to run on port 8080 of the container
   - Allow Internet access

Websoft9 offers users two deployment modes to run commands.  

#### Manual interactive deployments

User docker exec to container and execute doployment commands, this is **Manual deployment**: 

1. [Docker exec](./inner-container#docker-exec) to your container

2. Upload your packages to container and build it or other operation, below samples for your reference: 

   - [PHP](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/php/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Python](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/python/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Ruby](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/ruby/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Go](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/go/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Node.js](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/nodejs/src/cmd.sh)
   - [.NET](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/dotnet/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Java with OpenJDK](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/openjdk/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Java with Tomcat](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/tomcat/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Java with Tomee](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/tomee/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Java with Maven](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/maven/src/cmd.sh)
   - [Java with Jetty](https://websoft9.github.io/docker-library/apps/jetty/src/cmd.sh)


3. Start program in the background, command like this `nohup <your startup commands> > output.log 2>&1 &`

   - **your startup commands** sample:  `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080`
   - `nohup` command allows a process to continue running in the background when user has closed the terminal
   - `> output.log 2>&1 &` is specify the logs path
   - You need to execute nohup command again when restart container
   
#### Automated scripted deployment{#auto}

Automated script deployment executes tasks without manual intervention.

1. Login to Websoft9 Console, go to the [Compose](./app-compose) tab page of appli manage from **My Apps**
   ![](./assets/runtime-editcompose-websoft9.png)

2. Add your depoyment and startup process to *src/cmd.sh* which includes script sample for you references

   > Your cmd.sh script needs to be more robust, considering container restarts and redeploy.
    
   ![](./assets/runtime-composeedit-cmd-websoft9.png)

3. **Redeploy** the application, App Runtime container will execute the script for deployment

## Updating your deployment

Updating your deployment refers to the process of making changes to an already deployed application or service. This can involve a variety of tasks, including: 

### Changing version

It only need two steps for changing version for App Runtime: 

1. Get the support version from file `variables.json` at your repository

2. Change the value of W9_VERSION at file `.env` 

3. Reploy the application

### Convert to DevOps workflows 

Websoft App Runtime, based on GitOps, easily transforms program environments into developer-friendly DevOps workflows.  

1. Login to Websoft9 Console, and [Add user](./plan-git#user) at **Websoft9 Git**

2. Grant the new user the authority to manage the Git repository

3. Push your source code to Git repository for development

4. Updating deployment for DevOps

   - Add source code volume at file  `docker-compose.yml`
   - Add build commands at  file `src/cmd.sh`

## Troubleshooting

### Source of container images?

All container images are officially maintained by Docker or provided by the program's original manufacturer, and are 100% native, with no modifications. 

### How can I customize deployment?

You can customize deployment by these files at application's repository

- `.env`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `src/cmd.sh`

### Run multiply apps in one container?

Don't suggest this

### How to change files permissions?

Execute a command like `chown -R <owner>:<owner> /<path?`

### How to add startups to container?

You can add your startup commands to container by below methods: 

- Add commands to file `src/cmd.sh`
- Exec to container and running the required process in the background, command like this `nohup  Your CMD here  > output.log 2>&1 &`

### How can see the process via **nohup**?

Execute a command `jobs`

### How to delete the running process?

Execute `ps aux` to find the PID, then execute `kill -9 PID`
